## What is Modmail?

Modmail's core functionality provides an efficient communications interface between server members and staff. When a member sends a direct message to the bot, a channel is created within an isolated category for that member. This channel is where messages will be relayed and where any available staff member can respond to that user.

## Features

* **Highly Customisable**
  * Bot activity, prefix, category, log channel, etc.
  * Fully customisable command permission system.
  * Interface elements (color, responses, reactions, etc.)
  * Snippets and *command aliases*
  * Minimum account/guild age in order to create a thread.
* **Thread logs**
  * When you close a thread, a [log link](https://logs.modmail.tk/example) is generated and posted to your log channel.
  * Rendered in styled HTML like Discord.
  * Optional login in via Discord to protect your logs.
  * See past logs of a user with `?logs`
  * Searchable by text queries using `?logs search`
* **Robust implementation**
  * Scheduled tasks in human time, e.g. `?close in 2 hours silently`.
  * Editing and deleting messages is synced on both ends.
  * Support for the full range of message content (mutliple images, files).
  * Paginated commands interfaces via reactions.
  
This list is ever growing thanks to active development and our exceptional contributors. See a full list of documented commands by using the `help` command.

## Installation

### Heroku
Currently, the easiest way to set up the bot is by using Heroku, a container-based cloud platform. Installation via Heroku is done in your web browser and keeps the bot online 24/7 for free. The [**installation guide**](https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail/wiki/Installation) will guide you through the entire installation process. If you run into any problems, join the [development server](https://discord.gg/etJNHCQ) for help and support.

Installation locally for development reasons or otherwise is as follows, you will need `python 3.7`.

Clone the repo
```console
$ git clone https://github.com/kyb3r/modmail
